	 * Request that a local repository preserve a copy

	 * with a given handle, and all links that were dereferenced
	 * to read the stream.
	 * 
	 * A local repository is one connected
	 * directly to the same ccnd as the given handle; such a repository
	 * is likely to be special in the sense that it may be available to local
	 * applications even when there is no connectivity beyond the local 
	 * machine.  An application reading certain content that it did not originate
	 * may have reason to need that content to be available reliably as connectivity changes
	 * in the future. Since the application is not the source of the content, it need
	 * only ask the local repository to be interested in it rather than creating an
	 * output stream to write it. This method serves that purpose.
	 * 
	 * This method is experimental and the way of addressing this problem 
	 * is likely to change in the future.
	 * 
	 * This method may fail (IOException) if the local repository is not already
	 * configured to support holding the data in question. For example, the 
	 * repository policy might not admit the namespace in question
	 * and this method does not override such overall policy.
	 * 
	 * There may be more than one local repository but this method does not 
	 * presently distinguish one if that is the case.  Any one local repository
	 * that is available may be used, and at most one should be expected to respond to
	 * the request. This method should verify that a confirmation is from an acceptable
	 * local repository.
	 * 
	 * If the repository already holds the content it may confirm immediately, otherwise the repository
	 * will begin to retrieve and store the content but there is no guarantee that this is complete
	 * upon return from this method. The return value indicates whether data is already confirmed.
	 * 
	 * @param handle the handle
	 * @param stream The stream for which the content should be preserved
	 * @return boolean true iff confirmation received from repository
	 * @throws IOException if no repository responds or another communication error occurs
