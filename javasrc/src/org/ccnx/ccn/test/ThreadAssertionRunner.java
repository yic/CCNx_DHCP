/**
 * Junit cannot catch exceptions from spawned threads.  This wrapper class
 * will catch assertion failures in a Runnable and report them to the caller.
 * 
 * Junit Assert.X method throw an AssertionError, which is a Throwable -> Error -> AssertionError.
 * So, we capture both an Error and an Exception.  Don't use Throwable, as those get
 * messy to handle in the caller.
 * 
 * How to use:
 * 1) Create a Runnable class (could even be anonymous inner class), and wrap it in a
 *    ThreadAssertionRunner:
 *    
 *    ThreadAssertionRunner tar = new ThreadAssertionRunner(new MyRunner(some_parameter));
 * 
 * 2) Start the Runner like a thread:
 * 
 *    tar.start();
 *    
 * 3) Do normal processing, then stop your runnable.  You must join the Runner to wait for exit.
 *    THIS STEP IS REQUIRED (it's the join that reports any exceptions or errors from the run()
 *    method of your runnable):
 * 
 *    tar.join();
 *
