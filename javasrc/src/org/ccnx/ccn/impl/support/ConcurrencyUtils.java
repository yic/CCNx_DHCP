	 * A generic waiter implemented as an abstract class
	 * 
	 * The generic waiter handles timeouts and deciding whether to continue waiting
	 * on spurious wakeup based on a condition. You can hand it an Object to synchronize on
	 * (syncValue) and an Object to check. Both are handed back to the abstract check method as
	 * the parameters "syncValue" and "checkValue".  The wait ends when either check(syncValue, checkValue)
	 * returns true or the timeout expires.
	 * 
	 * A convenient way to use the waiter is to instantiate the abstract method in an anonymous class.
	 * So for example, if you wanted to wait 500 ms for a static Boolean foo to become true and 
	 * synchronize on an Object named lock you could do it like this, instantiating "check" in the 
	 * anonymous class to check the value of foo:
	 * 
	 * \verbatim
	 * Object lock = new Object();
	 * new Waiter(500) {
	 * 		@Override
	 *		protected boolean check(Object syncValue, Object checkValue) throws Exception {
	 *			return (Boolean)checkValue;
	 *		}
	 *	}.wait(lock, foo);
	 * \endverbatim
