Changes between 0.3.0 and 0.4.0:
--------------------------------
This highlights some important changes since the most recent numbered release.
Refer to http://www.ccnx.org/redmine/ for more details.
 
  * The 'ping' responder in ccnd is deprecated. For compatibility, it is still
    present by default, but further use should be phased out. The libraries
    have been changed to use local service discovery instead. The java option
    "org.ccnx.ping.timeout" is replaced by "org.ccnx.ccndid.timeout".
    (100187, 100188, 100189)
  * Responsibility for key saving has been shifted from the client library to
    repo. The Java API did not change but, as the result of a protocol change,
    the new library is not compatible with the old repo. (100288)
  * The Java library now uses TCP to communicate with ccnd, rather than UDP,
    to avoid problems and inefficiencies caused by UPD packet drops. (100078)
  * An explicit lifetime element has been added to Interest messages in order
    to give applications control of their timeouts. (100127)
  * FlowControl addNameSpace is now logged at info in the constructor. (100180)
  * ContentObjects are now created earlier to improve throughput by more
    efficiently balancing tasks between different threads. (100197)
  * Performance of writes has been improved by avoiding copies when the
    application is only calling write with integral multiples of the segment
    size. (100206)
  * The ccnseqwriter command has been installed and documented. (100227)
  * The traffic meters in the ccnd status display have been improved by
    metering activity in both directions, splitting out by content/interest,
    and showing rates as well as totals. (100256)
  * Android ccnChat uses a multicast interface by default, which does not work
    well in the emulator. To address this, an option to use a point-to-point
    face has been added to the configuration screen. (100267)
  * A sequence number has been added to each packet, encoded so that it is
    distinguishable from interest and content packets, that allows the
    receiving side to detect missing packets. (100275)
  * The CommonOutput doPut() method now returns the version written so command
    line utilities know the version name just created. In addition, logging in
    the while() loop in do_write has been isolated for improved performance.
    (100276)
  * java.library.path and -Xcheck:jni are now forwarded to daemon (100279)
  * Stream access for CCN segments has been added to the C library. (100283)
  * Support was added to the library for splitting an interest when the
    exclusion list gets too big. (100290)
  * The ccncat command was converted to use the ccn_fetch library in order to
    take advantage of pipelining. (100291)
  * Efficiency of flow controller was improved with more fine grained locking.
    (100299)
  * Counters were added to the CCNNetworkManager to facilitate debugging.
    (100300)
  * stats and clearstats signals were added to Repo. (100302)
  * A categorized statistics interface was added. (100306)
  * The efficiency of getRegisteredPrefix was improved. (100309)
  * An example of ccnb encoding of a data packet payload in Java was created.
    (100312)
  * The KeyDirectory class was split into a KeyDirectory base class and a
    PrincipalKeyDirectory subclass to make the KeyDirectory structure
    available for purposes other than Access Control. (100316)
  * The HTTP proxy demo code was added. (100322)
  * The performance of ContentName.fromURI() was improved. (100323)
  * Facility-based logStackTrace and logException methods were added. (100326)
  * Additional tests were added to verify that the InterestListener continues
    to auto-refresh the interest even when an InterestFilter for the same exact
    name as the InterestListener is closed on the same handle. (100327)
  * Performance was improved for ContentName.componentParseURI(). (100331)
  * A StatusResponse message type was added to allow such things as an error
    response for prefix registrations. (100341)
  * CCN_FORW_TAP was added to repo prefix registration. (100342)
  * Repo no longer unnecessarily uses multiple Interest handlers. (100343)
  * Implemented more useful interactions between forwarding flags. In
    particular, the definition of CCN_FORW_TAP includes the provision that it
    is not subject to capture, and flags that have an effect on the prefix as a
    whole (including CCN_FORW_CAPTURE) do not change behavior depending on the
    setting of CCN_FORW_ACTIVE. (100345)
  * Synchronization in InterestTable was improved. (100353)
  * CCNNetworkManager was updated to limit thread creation for handlers.
    (100354)
  * The following enhancements were made to ccntestloop: (100356)
    - Accumulate testout directories outside of javasrc
    - Read config via script
    - Handle start/stop/restart/status verbs
    - All output to files (when using start verb)
    - Handle kill better
    - Record pid
    - Allow configuration of port range
  * Instances of ccnd are now allocated dynamically to allow more testing
   flexibility. (100363)
  * The log command in utilities now sets the level for all facilities.
    (100364)
  * Java interest handling code now has a log facility. (100366)
  * A Java library routine that sets the ccnd caches stale has been created to
   ensure that readbacks are actually from repo and not from the cache.
    (100367)
  * Logging between CCNNetworkManagers and CCNNetworkChannel has been made
    unique. Note that there is no relationship between CCNNetworkManager ids
    and Channel ids. (100432)
  * openssl for Android builds are now based on 1.0.0d. (100438)
  * ccnChat was updated to publish its keys under the chat channel namespace.
    (100439)
  * A testing framework was added to make assertions in child threads
    catchable. (100454)
  * ccnd is now able to sense the presence of other end (i.e., to distinguish
    between loss of connection and simple lack of incoming data). (100461)
  * Added a junit to check that prefixes are as expected in the FIB when
    doing localRepoSync. (100464)
  * [Support] Instructions in the README for ccnchat were enhanced. (100338)
  * [Support] Description of forwarding flags used in
     ccn_set_interest_filter_with_flags (100467)

Changes between 0.2.0 and 0.3.0:
--------------------------------
 
  * Android support. This release includes support for Android 2.1 platform 
    development. (100246)
  * Self-registration protocol. This functionality allows clients to register
    the prefixes for interests they wish to receive. (100071, 100072, 100073) 
    The old form of self-registration (operating on the prefix 
    ccnx:/ccnx/reg/self) has been removed. (100114)
  * Prefix registration on incoming connections. For a ccnd to act as a hub
    (as in a hub-and-spoke configuration) there needs to be a way to get prefix
    registration on incoming connections. Eventually, routing agents will 
    perform this operation. This implementation retains the 'flooding' behavior
    of earlier releases for selected prefixes. NOTE: this requires explicit
	additional configuration via CCND_AUTOREG setting. (100225)
  * ccnd_destroy(). This functionality provides improved flexibility beyond 
    exit() to free up all resources. (100051)
  * destroyface(). Implementation of the previously documented functionality.
    (100068)
  * ccnChat improvements:
    * This release changes ccnchat() to display user friendly names instead 
      of partial key digest (100214). 
    * ccnchat is refactored to be re-usable, called from the ccnChat.java GUI 
      and the ccnChatNet.java module. It is also available on the command line:  
         bin/ccnchat -text namespace 
      (100234). 
    * ccnchat now verifies the first packet: if verification fails, it rejects
      that version and looks for a later one. (100163)
  * Performance improvements in CCNNetworkObject. This release includes a 
    revamp of the network objects including a few major API changes (100088): 
    * Write constructors create flow controllers at construction time, leaving
      lazy creation for read constructors. Write constructors make/take a FC 
      start listening for interests for their base name immediately (if they
      know it) 
    * The repository is the default behavior for network objects, rather than
      "raw".
  * Support a customized DTAG dictionary. This release changes the 
    ccn_ccnbtoxml and ccn_xmltoccnb tools so that a customized dictionary could
    be provided at runtime; this enables the tools to be used for protocols 
    that live outside of the CCNx base. (100129)
  * Key naming. This release defines the KeyProfile (100055) and uses it for 
    key ids, guids, and other component types (100131).  This change is 
    incompatible with existing header naming; backward compatibility is enabled
    by default. 
  * Still-pending interests behavior. This release changes how ccnd keeps track
    of the outbound faces for an interest. In the new representation, 
    pe->outbound is kept in send order instead of the reverse, and the new 
    index pe->sent is advanced as the faces are used. This leaves a trail of 
    the faces that have been used already, giving more flexibility in altering 
    the outbound list to the right of pe->sent. (100103)
  * Repository publishes public key. Any app that wants to depend on name 
    enumeration, checked writes, etc, needs to be able to validate who a 
    repository is. This release includes publishing the repository key using 
    localhost key discovery, making it easier to configure where the repository
    publishes its key. (100144)
  * javax.xml streams. Removed as many dependencies as possible such that their
    use is isolated to the text xml encoder/decoder. (100053)
  * Access control to stream/object encryption. The access control system 
    allows you to assign keys to content/recipients, and automatically retrieve
    keys. In this release, the output and input streams (and the network 
    objects that use them) retrieve keys and automatically encrypt content. 
    (100063)
  * Bulk import to repo. This release supports bulk importing of a sequence of 
    content objects (data) from a file in a single operation. The file must 
    contain content objects in wire format. The repository can incorporate the 
    file as a new storage file directly if that is compatible with its store 
    format. (100210)
  * Local repo save and save-type override. This release supports objects and 
    streams to be written to a local (same device) repo (100213). In addition, 
    it implements an environment variable to allow objects to be saved in a 
    local repository even if they were generically coded to be written to 
    any/multiple repos (100223).
  * Localhost tcp peers considered friendly. Now ccnd considers tcp connections
    from localhost to be "friendly" and only considers incoming localhost udp 
    traffic to be "friendly" if it starts out with a heartbeat packet. (100120)
  * Next-neighbor scope. For applications that want to be assured that they are
    communicating only with immediately neighboring machines, this release 
    defines a new allowed Scope value in the interests. (Scope = 2) (100123)
  * EnumeratedNameList methods. This release includes methods to replace 
    deprecated methods in EnumeratedNameList. (100230)
  * Capture-prefix flag. In the FIB, if a shorter registration has the 
    CCN_FORW_CHILD_INHERIT set, a registration for a longer match can't be used
    to prevent the interest from being propagated. This release includes a flag
    that can be applied on the longer prefix to override the effect of 
    CHILD_INHERIT on the shorted prefixes. (100116)
  * Prefix registration using a ContentName. In this release, the 
    PrefixRegistrationManager accepts a ContentName object for the prefix to 
    register in addition to a URI encoded string. (100186)
  * Multicast traffic. ccnd is now able to set up multicast using the standard
    ccnd socket. This involved changing the way ccnd keeps track of the sending
    side when the multicast cannot be done using a single socket. Instead of
    keeping 2 fds per face, ccnd now keeps 1 fd and a faceid to be used for 
    datagram sends. Because the faceids are never reused, the bookkeeping 
    becomes simpler.
 A user-visible side effect of this is that there are now 
    faces visible in the status display that are not used for ccnx traffic. 
    These represent the stream listeners and the datagram sockets that are 
    shared among other faces. They carry the face flag CCN_FACE_PASSIVE. 
    (100135)
  * Timeouts. Timeouts are now settable for situations which may require longer
    than usual timeouts. (100153)
  * Key cache. You can set a variable to control whether or not to save/load 
    the key cache. This variable is set to false by default. (100154)
  * ccn directory location. libccn now uses the CCNX_DIR environment variable.
    (100026)
  * Compatibility with openssl-1.0.0beta4 and following. ccn is now compatible
    with the STACK_OF macro and related changes in the OpenSSL code. (100095)
  * Local service discovery protocol. This release introduces the 
    CCN_FORW_LOCAL forwarding flag. The presence of this flag in a FIB entry 
    marks the namespace as local to the host (more specifically, to apps 
    directly connected to the ccnd in question). This is in support of 
    implementing a host-local namespace useful for local service discovery. 
    The ccnd does its best to make sure that content within such a namespace 
    comes only from local apps, and is delivered only to local apps.
    There is one known flaw in the current implementation, namely that an 
    off-machine attacker could cause a stale content object in the local 
    space to become fresh again. To do this, the attacker would have to 
    already have a copy of the C.O., which was supposed to be machine-local.
    Thus there must also be some collusion going on for this to happen. 
    (100134)
  * Logging changes. This release includes a number of changes to logging 
    configuration and content:
    
* Log messages use the facility name for the logger name instead of 
      org.ccnx.ccn.CCNHandle for everything. This change makes it easier to
      find specific facility related messages in large log files. The 
      DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CLASS must be a prefix in the Logging namespace of
      the other loggers so that they inherit the handlers added to it. (100185)
    
* ccntestloop now keeps logs for failed runs and the last few successes, 
      and deletes the rest. (100220) 
    
* This release allows you to reduce the number of messages produced by 
      ccndstart.sh: specify CND_LOG for ccndstart so ccndstart will discard 
      messages about stuffing the cache. (100069) 
    
* Stream open/close events are now logged. (100181)
    
* FAC_USERxx facility names include more complete logging. (100183)

  * Many small bug fixes to address issues with tests.
  * Clarity and documentation: The RepositoryDataListener method and variable 
    names better reflect the current functionality (100216); there is now a 
    manpage entry for ccndstatus (100232).
  * Interests. Bugs fixed for interest handling behavior include:
    
* Repo generating new responses to ccnls interests (100102)

    * Java library sending explicit AnswerOriginKind in interests, using the 
      default value (100106)
    
* Change default behavior for ccnput command to wait for interest (100117)
    
* ccnd occasionally retransmits interest (spurious interest re-expression 
      fixed) (100121)
    
* ccnd can occasionally fail to remove interests from prefix table 
      (100226)

  * Pipeline fixes. The release includes the following fixes in the area of 
    pipelining data segments:
    
* MetadataProfile getLatestVersion() will no longer append a version based
      on the current time if there is no version found in the network in the 
      passed-in timeout (100233)
    
* Pipeline code sent the first segment interest when version was not known
      yet (100141)
    
* Pipelining initialization problem: Some timing circumstances caused 
      pipelining to hang (100194)

    * Repo pipelining now issues new interest before processing received 
      content
failed verification and advancing the pipeline (100221)

  * Streaming fixes. The release includes the following fixes in the area of
    streaming data:
    
* CCNAbstractInputStream now uses Long instead of String for readerReady
      (100204)
    
* NullOutputStream now provides byte string methods to reduce call 
      overhead (100212)
    
* Input streams now call close() and close() shuts down pipelining and 
      closes any headers that might be retrieved (or attempted). (100235)

  * ccn_resolve_version(). The exclude filter is now fixed to always return the
    highest version; ccn_resolve_version() returns quickly if a version is 
    already present.
  * Repo FreshnessSeconds. This release increases the FreshnessSeconds on
    repository startWrite() response to 12 sec from 1 sec so transactional data
    are not held for a long time in ccnd. (100139)
  * Issues Resolved:
    * Bug #100012 java ContentObject code calculates digest on content only
    * Bug #100018 content explorer takes exception when there is no repo
    * Bug #100044 ccnget -c returns incorrect status
    * Bug #100061 ccnd Exclude processing needs performance improvement

                  content
    * Bug #100074 ccn_initkeystore.sh fails if $USER is not set
    * Bug #100076 Use of $$ in csrc/tests/test-* considered harmful
    * Bug #100085 ccnchat doesn't work with java 1.5 by default
    * Bug #100090 Java ContentType definition for ENCR does not match the one 
                  in ccn.h
    * Bug #100093 seg fault in ccndc
    * Bug #100098 ccnchat gets illegalArgumentException for empty line
    * Bug #100099 Implement unreg action in ccnd - unregister prefix
    * Bug #100108 Some system loggers can't handle log parameters
    * Bug #100109 Java prefix registration should not use interest nonces
    * Bug #100110 ccnd blocks when attempting a connect
    * Bug #100113 ccnd does not allow clearing of flags in FIB
    * Bug #100124 Logging can cause repository to deadlock
    * Bug #100126 Java header creation inconsistent with ccnx.xsd header schema
    * Bug #100130 ccnsendchunks / ccncatchunks block size problems
    * Bug #100136 Nonce-based interest suppression in ccd is incomplete
    * Bug #100137 The handling of responses from the ccnd internal client does
                  not cope with multiple messages in the buffer, causing them 
                  to be discarded.
    * Bug #100151 All Repo related logging should use FAC_REPO
    * Bug #100176 EnumeratedNameList.getNewData only gets data once
    * Bug #100179 ServiceKeyDiscoveryTest hardwires data writing into "."
    * Bug #100184 getLatestVersion resets the attempt time
    * Bug #100191 Java ForwardingEntry object validation is incorrect
    * Bug #100200 The constructor for PublisherPublicKeyDigest(String) should 
                  raise an exception if the string is not a proper base64Binary
                  encoding. Both that and the PublisherPublicKeyDigest(byte [])
                  constructor should probably raise an exception if the input
                  is too long, rather than silently truncating. 
    * Bug #100208 It is possible for WaitForPutDrain to go into an endless loop
                  rather than throwing an exception when the buffer hasn't been
                  drained correctly.
    * Bug #100231 Fix ccndc delete command to correctly remove prefix 
                  registration rather than attempting to destroy a face.
    * Bug #100240 Java library missing some forwarding flag definitions
    * Bug #100244 CCNNetworkManager code should log using FAC_NETMANAGER 
                  facility
    * Bug #100252 Reduce number of writing threads in network manager

Changes between 0.1.2 and 0.2.0:
--------------------------------
  NOTE: 0.2.0 introduces some changes to the core CCNx protocol, most notably
   a change in the definition of ephemeral digests.

  * The implicit digest component used as the last component in the
    name of a ContentObject, used in Links and Exclude filters, 
    now use the digest of the entire encoded ContentObject, rather than 
    merely the digest of the CO's content field. This allows exclusion of inadvertent or
    malicious traffic with the same name and content but different signing information
    from the intended traffic. Described in doc/technical/DigestComponent.txt
  * Removed dependency on javax.xml.streams. Replaced with stream-based XML Pull
    parser as implemented in the kXML library (http://kxml.sourceforge.net/). 
    This removes the JDK 1.5-specific requirement for JSR 173 jars; JDK 1.5 users
    can delete jsr173.jar and jsr173_ri.jar from their lib directories.
  * Repositories now have their own key pairs, rather than using the user's default
    key. This will enable policy-related communication with the repo and more
    sophisticated, multi-repository name enumeration protocols.
  * Implementation of the registration protocol, which allows clients to register
    with ccnd the prefixes for Interests they wish to receive, is well under way
    (see issues #100071, #100072, #100073). Until this code is stable, we will
    retain the default Interest flooding behavior. 
  * Initial version of Java-based registration control client, ccndcontrol, analogous
    to ccndc.
  * Added new ccnFileProxy application, and start script bin/ccnfileproxy; this
    proxies a specified portion of local file space to CCNx. Note that the proxy currently
    does not respect access controls, and will make all files it can read available.
  * Logging cleanups and improvements throughout.
  * Bump CCN_API_VERSION to 2000.
  * Make a more palatable C API for signing content objects; see ccn_sign_content(...).
  * Fix -v handling for ccnputfile.
  * Remove troublesome uses of $$ in csrc/tests/test_* (Bug #100076)
  * Fix ccn_initkeystore.sh to not rely on $USER. Use the id command instead.
  * Start to make configuration settings more robust to platform variations; improved
    options for controlling KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY, CCN_DIR and username.
  * Fix ccnd to verify the signatures in face management and registration requests.
  * Added a C library mechanism for obtaining ccndid, needed by self-registration.
  * Allow ccndsmoketest to send zero-length datagrams if so instructed.
  * Remove unused ccn_signed_info_create_default() from API.
  * Add vlc parameters to control:
  		ccn-fifo-maxblocks -- the maximum number of blocks held in the FIFO
		ccn-fifo-blocksize -- the size of blocks queued in the FIFO
  * Improved vlc plugin to use data prefetching, and attempt reconnection when
  	  disconnected from ccnd.
  * Make the XML jar file a property so it can be overriden on the command 
  	line if using different library.
  * Cleanup, bug fixes and additional tests for access control code.
  * Many small bugfixes to address issues with tests.
  * Issues Resolved:
    * Feature #100010 Change implicit digest component
    * Bug #100012 java ContentObject code calculates digest on content only
    * Bug #100020 repo policy files should be able to span multiple ContentObjects
    * Bug #100022 hashtb.c needs the delayed finalization case to be implemented
    	  Was included in 0.1.2.
    * Bug #100031 ccnd should check for AF_UNIX
    * Bug #100034 CCNWriter doesn't take preexisting Interests
    * Bug #100048 perror calls in ccnd should use ccnd_msg instead
    * Bug #100050 Refactor ccnd for improved flexibility in file locations and logging
    		Added CCN_LOCAL_SOCKNAME and CCND_KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY variables.

    * Feature #100053 remove dependency on javax.xml streams
    * Feature #100054 repository needs its own keys
    * Feature #100066 unsolicited content should not cause ccnd to toss good content
    * Feature #100067 Refactor ccnd keystore directory
    * Feature #100068 Implement destroyface in ccnd
    * Feature #100069 make ccndstart.sh less chatty
    * Feature #100071 Self-registration protocol in ccnd
    * Bug #100076 Use of $$ in csrc/tests/test-* considered harmful
    * Bug #100077 Please write some more code here (reduced debugging output)
    * Bug #100079 ccnputfile does not write any segments for zero-length files
    * Bug #100083 ccnd not listening to both ipv4 and ipv6 tcp addresses on Linux

    Known issues:
    * intermittent Java test failures, usually around failure to retrieve
      segments; there is work in process that we expect will
      fix most of these
    * intermittent failures of the C test test_destroyface
    * intermittent JVM crashes on Java 1.5 on OSX Leopard
    * the default ant/jUnit on Solaris 11 doesn't work; you need to
      copy over the ant-junit.jar from /usr/grails/1.0.3/ant/lib/ant-junit.jar
      to /usr/share/lib/ant/ant-junit.jar

Changes between 0.1.1 and 0.1.2:
--------------------------------
  NOTE: ccnChat will not inter-operate with older versions due to fix for #100030.
  * Changes to crypto implementation for compatibility with older versions of
    BouncyCastle and configurations with varied crypto support. Also improved
    handling of crypto providers.
  * Added stopall argument to ccn_repo command to stop all running repos on
    machine.
  * Turned off ccnd message about heartbeats by default (use CCND_DEBUG=128 to
    get these messages back).

    * Bug #100024 BasicKeyManager passes null to generateConfigurationException.
    * Bug #100030 ccnChat/default network string shouldn't use Java 
                  serialization. Converted Java CCNStringObject to use UTF-8
                  string encoding.
    * Bug #100039 ccn.h should have an API version identifier.
