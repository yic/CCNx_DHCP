CCNSEQWRITER(1)
===============

NAME
----
ccnseqwriter - Send data from stdin using ccn versioning and segmentation.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ccnseqwriter* [-h] [-b 'blocksize'] [-r] 'ccnx:/some/uri'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ccnseqwriter* utility creates new ccn content using stdin as the source
of data.
The argument is a CCNx URI to be used for the newly signed data; appropriate
versioning and segmentation will be added.

Unless the "-r" option is used, no attempt is made to save the data in a repository, so if nothing expresses
interest in the data, *ccnseqwriter* will simply wait forever.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
	Print usage to stderr and exit.

*-b* 'blocksize'::
	Use given blocksize instead of the default (1024 bytes).
	The maximum size allowed is 4096 bytes.

*-r*::
	Generate a start-write request to a repository.
	The start-write is not scoped, so a remote repository may answer.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (diagnostic error written on stderr)
